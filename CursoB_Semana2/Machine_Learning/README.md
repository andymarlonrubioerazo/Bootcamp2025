## Machine Learning
###  Juan Rafael Martínez Galarza (AstroAI, CfA, Harvard & Smithsonian)

This course will provide the students with a starting toolkit for the use of machine
learning in astronomy, with an emphasis on state-of-the-art approaches of self-supervised
learning, sequential analysis , and statistical inference. The goal is twofold: provide a general
overview of traditional tools in machine learning in astronomy (e.g. convolutional neural
networks for supervised image classification), while at the same time introducing the students to
the latest developments in the field (e.g. self-supervised learning, transformers, simulation
based inference). The course will include practical exercises in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
